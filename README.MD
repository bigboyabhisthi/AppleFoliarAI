<h1 align = "center"> Apple Foliar AI</h1>

## Background:

Apple is a widely consumed fruit across the world which has over 7500 cultivars in temperate and subtropical climates. Nt only do they hold paramount importance for people's dietary requirements but also drive profitable businesses in several nations. The production and distribution of apples is often hindered by foliar diseases. Currently, the workers on the orchards do scouting to manually identify these diseased leafs and segregate them. For large scale orchards, this eventually turns out to be cumbersome and resource demading. Hence there is a requirement for an automated system to assist in this problem. We propose the use of neural network based algorithms to tackle this issue of diagnosis.

## Data:

We would making use of the Plant Pathology dataset[1] used in the Eight Workshop on Fine-Grained Visual Categorization held in conjuction with CVPR 2021.

The dataset is structured as follows:

```terminal
|
|-- train images
|-- train.csv : CSV file comprising metadata for training images
      |
      |-- image ID: Basically name of the images
      |
      |-- labels: disease that the apple leaf is diagnosed with
|-- test images: 5003 images
|-- sample_submission.csv: Similar to train.csv. To be populated after training the model on the train images and getting inference on the test images
```

Our training data is classified into the following categories:

| Foliar Disease Condition        | Number of Images |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Scab                            | 4826             |
| Healthy                         | 4624             |
| frog_eye_leaf_spot              | 3181             |
| Rust                            | 1860             |
| Complex                         | 1602             |
| Powdery_mildew                  | 1184             |
| scab frog_eye_leaf_spot         | 686              |
| scab frog_eye_leaf_spot complex | 200              |
| frog_eye_leaf_spot complex      | 165              |
| rust frog_eye_leaf_spot         | 120              |
| rust complex                    | 97               |
| powdery_mildew complex          | 87               |

## Usage:

- Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/smaranjitghose/AppleFoliar.ai.git
```

- Move inside the AppleFoliar.AI directory
